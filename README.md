# 🔍 Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer data, the model aims to identify customers who are likely to cancel their services — helping businesses improve retention strategies.

## 🗂️ Project Files

- `Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full machine learning workflow — data preprocessing, EDA, model building, evaluation.
- `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluation.

---

## 📌 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes demographic, account, and service-related information for each customer, with a target variable indicating churn.

### Key Features:
- `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`
- `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`
- `PhoneService`, `InternetService`, `Contract`, `PaymentMethod`
- `Churn`: Target variable (Yes/No)

## 📈 Key Highlights

- Performed detailed data cleaning and EDA.
- Applied label encoding and scaling for ML readiness.
- Built and evaluated classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Achieved high accuracy and recall for churn detection.
- Visualized feature importance and model performance.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Results & Insights

- Longer contracts, paperless billing, and high monthly charges are strong churn indicators.
- The best-performing model achieved **~X% accuracy** (replace with actual result from the notebook).
- Feature importance highlighted key business drivers of churn.
